A one-to-many relationship in MongoDB describes a scenario where a single document (the "one" side) is associated with multiple documents (the "many" side). This kind of relationship is common in various applications, such as when a single user has multiple posts or a single blog has many comments.

Characteristics of One-to-Many Relationships
Parent-Child Relationship: The parent document (one) can have multiple child documents (many) linked to it.
Data Organization: Helps organize data in a way that reflects real-world relationships.
Querying: Depending on the approach (embedding or referencing), querying related data can vary in complexity.
